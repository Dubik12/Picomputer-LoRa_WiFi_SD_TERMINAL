This repository contains a like Terminal program that I made for my mini-computer Picomputer Bobricius (thanks to Bobricius) and it is a bit of a Linux emulator, a bit of a Win. I made something like Norton Commander to conveniently copy files from Sd to Filesystem. NC is a system overlay and supports text terminal commands. That's all for the beginning, later I will write something more, I will post photos and diagrams.
